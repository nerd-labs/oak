# firebase

Getting started with firebase.
Create a file inside the `public` directory called `firebase.config.js`.
Inside that file you put the following code:

```
export const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
    authDomain: "<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com",
}
```

Enter your own credentials from firebase.
